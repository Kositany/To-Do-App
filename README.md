# 📝 Welcome to Todo's App

This is a simple and efficient to-do application built with **Vue 3**. It allows you to manage your tasks easily, and your progress is saved automatically even after closing your browser.

## 🚀 How It Works

- ✅ **Create:**  
  Use the input field at the top to add a new task. Each task gets saved with a unique ID.

- 📌 **Check Complete:**  
  Toggle the checkbox to mark a task as **completed** or **not completed**.

- ✏️ **Edit:**  
  Click the **pencil icon** to edit a task, then click the **check icon** to save changes.

- 🗑️ **Delete:**  
  Click the **trash icon** to remove a task from your list instantly.

- 💾 **Saved Todos:**  
  Tasks are stored using `localStorage`, so your list remains even when you refresh or close the browser.

- 🎉 **Completion Message:**  
  When **all** todos are completed, you’ll see a special congratulatory message appear.
